# How to Build REAL Windows Executables

## The Problem
PyInstaller only creates executables for the platform it runs on. Building on macOS creates macOS executables, NOT Windows executables. That's why your professor got the "This app can't run on your PC" error.

## The Solution: GitHub Actions
Use GitHub's free Windows servers to build real Windows executables.

## Setup Steps:

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
cd /Users/estefanord/Desktop/game
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Control Shift game"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and create a new repository called "control-shift-game"
2. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
3. Copy the remote URL (something like: https://github.com/USERNAME/control-shift-game.git)

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/control-shift-game.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Trigger the Build
The GitHub Action will automatically run and build:
- ✅ **REAL Windows .exe** (built on Windows server)
- ✅ **REAL macOS executable** (built on macOS server)  
- ✅ **Linux executable** (built on Linux server)
- ✅ **Web version** (HTML5)

### 5. Download Built Executables
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click on the latest workflow run
4. Download the "all-platforms-release" artifact
5. Extract and you'll have proper executables for all platforms!

## Why This Works
- GitHub provides free Windows, macOS, and Linux virtual machines
- PyInstaller runs on each platform to create native executables
- No more fake .exe files - these are REAL Windows executables!

## Alternative: Manual Windows Build
If you have access to a Windows computer:
```batch
pip install pygame>=2.6.0 pyinstaller>=6.10.0
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=Control_Shift_Windows --add-data="assets/music;assets/music" --add-data="assets/sfx;assets/sfx" --add-data="assets/sprites;assets/sprites" --add-data="src;src" main.py
```

The GitHub Actions approach is recommended because it's free and creates executables for all platforms automatically.
