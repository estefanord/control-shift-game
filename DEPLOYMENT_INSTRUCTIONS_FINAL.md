# Control Shift - Web Deployment Instructions (FINAL WORKING VERSION)

## Summary

Your pygame game "Control Shift" has been successfully converted to work on the web using pygbag. After debugging and fixing CORS errors and configuration issues, the game now works properly in browsers.

## What Was Fixed

### Original Issues Identified:
1. **CORS Errors**: The game was trying to fetch pygame dependencies from `localhost:8000` while being served from a different port
2. **User Media Engagement Blocks**: Browser requiring user interaction before loading
3. **Configuration Problems**: Incorrect pygbag settings causing external dependency failures

### Solutions Applied:
1. **Proper Async Structure**: Modified your original game to use async/await pattern required by pygbag
2. **CORS Resolution**: Used correct CDN configuration to avoid cross-origin issues
3. **User Media Fix**: Disabled unnecessary user interaction requirements with `--ume_block=0`
4. **Clean Build**: Used proper build flags for itch.io deployment

## Final Working Files

### Main Files Created:
- `original_game_fixed/main.py` - Async wrapper for your game
- `original_game_fixed/src/game.py` - Your original game code (modified to remove run loop)
- `control_shift_working_web_deployment.zip` - **READY FOR ITCH.IO**

### Deployment Package:
ðŸ“¦ **File**: `control_shift_working_web_deployment.zip`
ðŸ“¦ **Size**: ~3.5MB (includes all your assets and music)
ðŸ“¦ **Status**: âœ… TESTED AND WORKING
