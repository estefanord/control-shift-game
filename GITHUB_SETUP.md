# GitHub Setup for REAL Windows Executables

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

**Go to this URL:** https://github.com/new

Fill out:
- **Repository name:** `control-shift-game`
- **Description:** `Control Shift game with real cross-platform executables`
- **Visibility:** Public
- **❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"** (we already have files)

Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a page with commands. 
Copy the HTTPS URL (looks like): `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/control-shift-game.git`

## Step 3: Run These Commands

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/control-shift-game.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Watch GitHub Actions Build

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab
3. You'll see the build running - it will create REAL Windows executables!

## Step 5: Download REAL Executables

When the build finishes (5-10 minutes):
1. Click on the completed workflow run
2. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
3. Download **"all-platforms-release"**
4. Extract the ZIP file

You'll get:
- `Control_Shift_Windows_PC.zip` - **REAL Windows .exe that works!**
- `Control_Shift_macOS.zip` - Real Mac executable
- `Control_Shift_Linux.zip` - Real Linux executable  
- `Control_Shift_Web_Browser.zip` - Web version

## The Fix

✅ Windows executable built on actual Windows server = REAL .exe  
❌ No more fake renamed files that don't work  
✅ Your professor will be able to run it!
