# Control Shift

## A Game of Control Discovery

Control Shift is an 8-bit platform game where each room changes the control mechanics in unique and unexpected ways. The player must discover how controls work in each new environment to progress through the game.

Inspired by Undertale's aesthetic with pink pastel elements, this game combines puzzle mechanics with platform gameplay to create a constantly evolving experience that challenges your adaptability.

## About This Game

This game was created as an exploration of interface subversion as artistic expression for a media art class. The artistic research behind the project can be found in the accompanying `artistic_research.txt` file.

## Controls

The game begins with standard controls, but these will change as you progress:
- Initially: Arrow keys or WASD to move and jump
- Each room introduces new control mechanics that you must discover

## How to Play

1. Double-click the "Control Shift" application to start the game
2. Experiment with different controls in each room to understand how they work
3. Reach the pink door in each room to progress
4. If you get stuck, falling off platforms will reset you to the beginning of the room

## For Media Art Context

This game explores several key concepts relevant to media art:
- Interface disruption as artistic expression
- The embodied relationship between player and controls
- Subversion of expectations as a form of procedural rhetoric
- Minimalist design philosophy focusing attention on interaction

The full artistic research document provides a deeper theoretical framework for understanding the game's relevance to media art studies.
