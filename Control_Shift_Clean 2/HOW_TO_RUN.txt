CONTROL SHIFT - How to Run on macOS

1. DOUBLE-CLICK "Control_Shift" to start the game

2. If you get a security warning:
   - Control-click (right-click) on "Control_Shift"
   - Select "Open" from the menu
   - Click "Open" when prompted
   - The game will start normally

3. Alternative method:
   - Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy
   - Click "Open Anyway" if you see the option
   - Then double-click the game again

The game is safe but the warning appears because it's not from the Mac App Store.

Have fun!
