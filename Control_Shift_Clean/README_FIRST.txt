ðŸŽ® CONTROL SHIFT ðŸŽ®
==================

ðŸš¨ MAC USERS - READ THIS FIRST! ðŸš¨

When you double-click "Control_Shift", you may see:
"Control_Shift cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"

THIS IS NORMAL! Here's how to fix it:

âœ… SOLUTION (takes 5 seconds):
1. Control-click (right-click) on "Control_Shift"
2. Select "Open" from the menu  
3. Click "Open" when asked "Are you sure?"
4. Game starts! ðŸŽ‰

Why does this happen?
- The game isn't from the Mac App Store
- Apple shows this warning for safety
- The game is completely safe!

ðŸŽ® ABOUT THE GAME:
Challenge yourself with 7 rooms where the controls change!
- Arrow Keys: Move (when they work normally!)
- Space: Start game
- Numbers 1-7: Jump to specific rooms

Each room has different control mechanics - from reversed controls to random chaos!

Have fun! ðŸš€
