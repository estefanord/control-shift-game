-Control Shift-

Conceptual Framework:

"Control Shift" explores the intersection of player agency, interface design, and control subversion as artistic expression. The primary statement is made through manipulating the player's relationship with the game controls.

Precedents/Influences:

1. Undertale (Toby Fox, 2015)
   - The globally popular game regularly subverts players expectations about agency
   - The bullet-hell segments that change the rules of engagement influenced the color palette and overall aesthetic of friendly hostility
   - The game's meta-commentary on choice inspired the story-like room narrative (to be implemented fully)

2. WarioWare Series (Nintendo, 2003-present)
   - Rapid-fire mini-games that constantly change control schemes
   - Is funny and challenges you through the interface 
   - Inspired the room-by-room approach to shifting controls

3. Experimental Art
   - Jodi's web art (1990s) 

Aesthetics:

1. Pastel Colors
   - Pink pastel elements inspired by vaporwave 
   - Juxtaposition of soft colors against dark backgrounds creates tension for the player
   - Color as wayfinding: to subtly guide players toward "getting" the new controls (to be implemented completely)

2. Minimalism
   - Less visual elements to emphasize the actual experience of control (and losing control)
   - Simple geometric shapes focus attention on movement/interaction

The 8-bit aesthetic is a personal choice as I particularly like how it reminds me of old games.
